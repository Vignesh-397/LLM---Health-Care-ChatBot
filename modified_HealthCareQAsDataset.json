    "answer": "i\u2019d rather not worry you further and i\u2019m no doctor but i\u2019m concerned. my aunt had this problem before i was even born. her shooting pain was an aneurysm. i\u2019ve been told aneurysms don\u2019t have an age limit; though i don\u2019t know how credible that is. it\u2019s a blood vessel in the brain that broke. i\u2019d follow up with a doctor immediately. another thing i would suggest is seeing a neurologist. she may have a nerve condition. anyway i\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll even see this. however i hope i helped and that your daughter gets well.",
